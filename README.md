Coursework from CSC 110 at UVic (Fall 2021)

Fundamentals of Programming I Introduction to designing, implementing, and understanding computer programs using Python. Topics include an introduction to computing and problem solving, testing, selection and iteration, lists, tuples, dictionaries, objects and classes, top-down design and incremental development.

Topics:
- basic syntax and semantics of a high-level language
- variables, expressions and assignment
- primitive and sequence types
- representation of numbers
- input/output (I/O)
- conditional and iterative control structures
- functions/methods and parameter passing
- problem-solving strategies (including structured decomposition)
- lists
- strings and string processing
- maps (dictionaries)
- data representation in memory
- linear search
- encapsulation and information hiding
- separation of behaviour and implementation
- classes
- exception handling
